### Welcome

Based in the **Washington Metropolitan area**, **Raha Mirzadegan** is a skilled young vocalist pursuing her **Master’s Degree** as a member of the **Maryland Opera Studio** this fall. She is particularly fond of performing repertoire from the **Early and Baroque periods**, yet equally values more recent works. She has sung as a chorister and soloist with the **award-winning Chamber Singers** of the **University of Maryland**, under the direction of **Dr. Edward Maclary**. As a current member of the Chamber Singers, she frequently collaborates with the **National and Baltimore Symphony Orchestras**, in venues such as the **Kennedy Center**, **Meyerhoff Symphony Hall**, and the **Music Center at Strathmore**. Furthermore, she is the **founder** and **director** of the **Maryland Monteverdi Society** – a group of eight vocalists dedicated to singing the music of the **Renaissance**.

She has been seen, as both **pianist** and **vocalist**, **premiering pieces** in the **New Music at Maryland** concert series, as a **featured soloist** for the **Washington Metropolitan Gamer Symphony Orchestra**, as the **soprano soloist** in **_Jesu, meine Freude_, BWV 227 by J.S. Bach**, in excerpts from **_A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ by Mendelssohn**, **_Laudate Dominum_ from Mozart’s _Vesperae solennes de confessore_**, **Howell’s _Requiem_** under the direction of **Matthew Halls**,  **_Wer da glaubet und getauft wird_ BWV 27 by J.S. Bach**, and as the **representative of the undergraduate voice department** in the 2017 **Honors Recital** at the University of Maryland.

On February 14th, 2017, the **Maryland Monteverdi Society** had their **debut performance**. For Valentine’s Day, Raha programmed a set of Renaissance love songs for an afternoon performance entitled **“Songs of Love & Devotion,”** in which the ensemble sang for their colleagues, faculty, and passersby in the atrium of the **Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center**. In honor of **Monteverdi’s 450th Birthday** on May 9th, the ensemble is set to perform a **lecture-recital**, entitled, **”Madrigals, Monody, Monteverdi,”** to demonstrate the transformation of musical drama. She believes that by presenting these works, in **accessible** and **succinct performances**, people may become **better acquainted** with selections from the **prolific music** of the 14th – early 17th centuries.

**Ms. Mirzadegan** is a vocal student of **Gran Wilson** at the University of Maryland, College Park. She aspires to continue making music to **inspire others** and foster a little **beauty** in the world.
